### passwords are stored encrypted

`Hashing` is the process of assigning a numeric value to an alphanumeric string by first converting it into another numeric value and storing it in an indexed table to make data retrieval faster and/or masking the data for encryption, performed by a hash function.

A `rainbow table` is in cryptanalysis, a data structure created in 2003 by Philippe Oechslin of EPFL1 to find a password from its fingerprint. It is an improvement of the time-memory tradeoffs proposed by Martin Hellman in the 1980.
